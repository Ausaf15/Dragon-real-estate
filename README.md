Developed a predictive model using a dataset of house prices with features such as the number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes. 
The primary goal was to accurately predict the price of a new house based on these features. Conducted data preprocessing including cleaning, normalization, and feature selection. 
Implemented various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests to build and train the predictive model. 
Evaluated model performance using mean squared error and root mean squared error to ensure accuracy and robustness.
